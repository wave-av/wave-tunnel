# TESTING

How wave-tunnel is tested, for people and for agents. The fenced
`yaml test-contract` block below is the machine surface: `contracts validate`
checks it, `contracts run` executes it and writes receipts, and the Stop gate
verifies receipts before an agent may claim DONE. Edit the YAML, keep the
fence line exactly as-is, and never paste secret values into it (fixture
NAMES only).

```yaml test-contract
version: "0.1"
entry: "npm test"
suites:
  all:
    cmd: "npm test"
    required: true
    timeout_s: 600
pass:
  exit: 0
forbidden:
  - skip-failing
  - delete-tests
  - mock-prod
  - claim-pass-on-timeout
flake:
  retries: 0
  on_flaky: fail
receipt:
  format: json
  path: .testmd/receipts
  bind: gitCommit
```

## Notes for contributors

- `contracts run` executes every suite and writes one receipt per suite
  under `.testmd/receipts/`. Nothing here edits `.gitignore`; whether the
  repo tracks receipts is the repo's decision.
- A receipt is bound to the contract text AND the git commit it ran at; edit
  either and the receipt goes stale — re-run.
- `all` is the required suite (`required: true`); optional suites
  (`required: false`) may fail without failing the gate.
